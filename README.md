# Hi 👋 I am Yooby Ruffieux (Gigandet)
### Data & Business Analyst

Welcome to my GitHub! 

Here, you will find a collection of projects I have been working on — from personal explorations to technical experiments and tools I have built to solve real problems. While I can't share work done for companies or under NDA, I am always expanding my public portfolio with projects that reflect my interests, learning, and growth as an analyst.

I am currently open to job opportunities. If my work aligns with what you are looking for, feel free to reach out.
